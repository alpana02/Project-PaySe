## ‚ÑπÔ∏è What is PaySe?
PaySe is a platform that proposes a way to implement AA framework using Setu API & Leverage AI/ML models to prevent consent frauds alongside providing credit to the unbanked using Alternate Data.

## ‚ú® What problem does PaySe solves?
Almost 90 percent of small businesses in India still have no links with formal financial institutions.
Primary reasons are :

- For _**Borrowers**_: <br>
The current lending process is quite tedious for a small business owner with intensive manual under-writing.
This leads to higher turnaround times to even get to an answer whether the customer is eligible or not.
Unbanked users find it very difficult to apply for loan since there is no check for creditworthiness.

- For _**Lenders**_: <br>
Banks continue to lose customers to bigger competitors banks, newer banks & now fin-tech companies.
Unable to get accurate creditworthiness of unbanked users because of lack of data

## üòµ‚Äçüí´ Challenges we ran into
Find the alternate dataset and creating it with the correct target column for the supervised learning model was a little tough but we overcame those hurdles
We faced issues initially while integrating Setu Account Aggregator API, but by following the docs we were able to do it.

## üõ†Ô∏è How we built it?
- The Frontend is built using **Next.js** & **Chakra UI**
- **Firebase Authentication** to authenticate the user via oAuth
- **Firebase Firestore** as our database to store data
- **SETU APIs** to implement Account Aggregator and Consent Request functionalities
- **Express.js** in-order to call the SETU APIs
- **Flask**, **Tensorflow** and **scikit-learn** library to implement Machine Learning models
